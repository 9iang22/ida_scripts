## plt_fix.py
Usage : run in ida </ br>
For:    This is a script try to fix plt error when gcc use `.plt.sec`, which will cause problems in my ida pro (7.0) <br />
TODO:   x86 is not available now, but it is easy to implement. And I don't know if it can run correct when pie is not enable, but it is also easy to fix. So if any problem, try to change a little code. <br />
